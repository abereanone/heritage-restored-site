  <h1>"Contraception" Methods</h1>
  <p>Below is a list of methods, categorized, with mechanism notes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Method</strong>: The name of the method.</li>
    <li><strong>Category</strong>: Indicates whether the method is contraceptive, abortifacient or abortive. Sadly, our world categorizes all of these as contraception to be deceptive.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Contraceptive</em> – Prevents conception. Does not result in the taking of a life.</li>
      <li><em>Abortive</em> – Used after conception to take a human life. Always murderous.</li>
      <li><em>Abortifacient</em> – Often used as contraceptive resulting in unsafe conditions for babies that do become conceived. Life is killed, but not always knowingly. Sometimes also used intentionally to murder the child.</li>
    </ul>    
    <li><strong>"Contraception" Mechanisms</strong>: A brief explanation of how the method works.</li>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Prevents ovulation</em> – no egg, no fertilization.</li>
      <li><em>Alters mucus</em> – Some contraceptives claim that they thicken cervical mucus, making it impenetrable to sperm. The effect, rather than being a barrier to contraception, is that it causes conceived children to die.</li>
      <li><em>Thinning uterine lining</em> – Thins the lining of the uterine wall (endometrium) to prevent implantation. Little one's homes are made uninhabitable.</li>
    </ol>    
  </ul>
