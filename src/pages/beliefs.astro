      <h2>1. Of the Holy Scriptures</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience... The authority of the Holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed, dependeth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God (who is truth itself), the author thereof; therefore it is to be received because it is the Word of God.”<br />LBCF 1.1, 1.4</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We believe the Bible is the Word of God, without error, and is the final authority in all matters of life and faith.</p>

    <section id="of-god-and-the-holy-trinity">
      <h2>2. Of God and the Holy Trinity</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“The Lord our God is but one only living and true God; whose subsistence is in and of himself, infinite in being and perfection; whose essence cannot be comprehended by any but himself; a most pure spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passions... In this divine and infinite Being there are three subsistences, the Father, the Word (or Son), and Holy Spirit... of one substance, power, and eternity, each having the whole divine essence, yet the essence undivided...”<br />LBCF 2.1, 2.3</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We believe in one God in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—equal in power and glory.</p>

    <section id="of-christ-the-mediator">
      <h2>3. Of Christ the Mediator</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“It pleased God, in His eternal purpose, to choose and ordain the Lord Jesus, His only begotten Son... to be the Mediator between God and man; the Prophet, Priest, and King; the Head and Savior of the Church; the Heir of all things; and Judge of the world...This office the Lord Jesus did most willingly undertake... and fulfilled it, and bore the wrath due to us, which we should have borne and suffered, being made sin and a curse for us.”<br />LBCF 8.1, 8.4</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We believe that Jesus Christ is truly God and truly man, who died for sinners, rose again, and reigns forever.</p>

    <section id="of-salvation-by-grace">
      <h2>4. Of Salvation by Grace</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“Those whom God hath predestinated unto life, he is pleased... to call effectually, and to draw them to himself... giving them a new heart and a new spirit; they come most freely, being made willing by his grace. Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ and his righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification...”<br />LBCF 10.1, 11.2</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We believe that salvation is by God’s grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.</p>

    <section id="of-the-church">
      <h2>5. Of the Church</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“The catholic (universal) church... consists of the whole number of the elect, that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one, under Christ the Head thereof...Each church, and all the members of it... are bound to walk in love towards one another, as becomes the saints...”<br />LBCF 26.1, 27.2</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We believe in the local and universal church and that saints are called to worship, love, and obey Christ as Head therein.</p>

    <section id="of-the-last-things">
      <h2>6. Of the Last Things</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“God hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in righteousness by Jesus Christ... the end of the world is come; the resurrection of the dead, both just and unjust, shall be...”<br />LBCF 32.1</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We believe that Jesus will return to judge the living and the dead, and that eternity awaits—either in life with Christ, or in separation from Him.</p>
