    <h2>The Mission of Heritage Restored</h2>

    <h3>Reclaiming the legacy God entrusted to us — and acting on it <strong>today</strong></h3>

    <h4>1 · Defend Every Child</h4>
    “Children are a heritage from Yahweh, the fruit of the womb a reward.” — <em>Psalm 127:3</em>
    <p>We stand unapologetically for the <strong>total abolition of abortion</strong>—no exceptions, no compromise. Every child bears the image of God, and every life matters for His glory.</p>

    <h4>2 · Honor the Legacy of the Faithful</h4>
    <p>We walk the path paved by the faithful men and women who came before us—not standing with them, but <strong>on their shoulders</strong>. Above all, we fix our eyes on <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>, the author and finisher of our faith, whose <strong>gospel</strong> has made us heirs of God's eternal Kingdom.</p>

    <h4>3 · Restore a Nation Worth Inheriting</h4>
    <p>We fight for a future where our children inherit a nation under God’s <strong>favor</strong>, not His <strong>judgment</strong>. That requires national repentance and a return to truth:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Conversion of hearts via the gospel of Jesus Christ</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Rejection of child sacrifice</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Defense of biblical marriage, sexuality, and gender roles</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Bold public acknowledgment of Christ as King</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>With repentance must come obedience—and with obedience, the hope that God may <strong>relent of the judgment</strong> we rightly deserve.</p>
