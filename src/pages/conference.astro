    <h1>Abolitionist Fellowship Conference & Mission</h1>
    <p>
      Heritage Restored is hosting our Abolitionist Fellowship Conference on Jan 24, 2026 so we can
      have a ton of fellowship, hear from the Word, pray, and encourage one another in the work of abolition. Over half the conference time is fellowship!

        the fellowship, or for both. We will send a short briefing as we get closer to the date.
