      <p>
        After the conference, anyone still in Columbus is invited to meet outside the Schottenstein Center for street
        ministry and conversational outreach during WinterJam. You are welcome to come only for the mission, only for
        the fellowship, or for both. We will send a short briefing as we get closer to the date.
